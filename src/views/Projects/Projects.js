            They are categorized as either educational or personal projects. Educational projects are projects that were required for my coursework at the University of Florida.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://heavenly-writing-horoscopes.herokuapp.com/Home"> This website</a> was created during the 2020 spring semester alongside James Boultinghouse, Joshua Chan, and Logan Welsh for our Software Engineering course.</p>
                        <p>We developed a website that will email horoscopes to users. The admin of the website can also add and edit the horoscopes they want to send to certain users.</p>
                        <p>As the "SCRUM Master" it was my job to handle pull requests and to keep our repository organized. It was also my responsibility to lead our stand up and sprint retrospective meetings.
                        Finally, James and I were the two developers on the team focused on frontend development. The home page pictured above was both designed and developed by me.

                        <p>We developed an Amazon Alexa Skill that can tell a user if a certain location is wheelchair accessible. At the end of the hackathon we won "People's Choice". </p>

                        <p>This project is a Slackbot that sends a Kanye West quote whenever the word "Kanye" is sent in a Slack channel.</p>
                        <p>Although this project was on the simpler side, it was really fun testing the bot alongside friends and seeing the random quote return.</p>
                        <p>This project was my first experience working with JavaScript and Slack's Slackbot API.</p>
